* Introduction

=indie-org= is an [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/Emacs][Emacs]] [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html#Packaging-Basics][package]] for getting [[https://indieweb.org/static_site_generator][staticly-generated]] web sites published with [[https://orgmode.org/org.html][Org-mode]]'s [[https://orgmode.org/org.html#HTML-Export][HTML Export]] facility onto the [[https://indieweb.org/][Indieweb]]. This project is currently experimental; this is first code. I may publish it to MELPA at some point, so I'm trying to respect both the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Coding-Conventions.html#Coding-Conventions][GNU]] and [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org][MELPA]] coding conventions.

* Prerequisites

=indie-org= requires Emacs 26.1 and Org-mode 9.5.3.

* Installing

At present =indie-org= is only available as source.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git clone git@github.com:sp1ff/indie-org.git
  cd indie-org
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure
  make
  make check
  sudo make install
#+END_SRC

The build process _does_ make an Emacs package, so you can also do:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # as above...
  make check
  make dist
#+END_SRC

to produce an Emacs package file (=indie-org-0.2.3.tar=) which you can install with =package-install-file= in your Emacs.

* Status & Roadmap

This is experimental, but I'm using it today with my personal [[https://www.unwoundstack.com][site]]. Bugs, feature requests and so on welcome!
