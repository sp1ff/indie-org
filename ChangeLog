	[#4 indie-org-posse-syndicated-copies is never used]
	This commit removes "syndicated copies" from `indie-org-state`.
	This is another breaking change since it introduces new versions
	of two structs:

	    1. `indie-org-state-v2`
	    2. `indie-org-posse-response-v2`

	It also re-writes the serde logic to no longer use the print form
	of structs, but rather serializes them to property lists in the
	hopes that future changes to structs won't necessitate introducing
	new versions thereof.

2023-02-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Adding several files to the source tarballs that were missing in the initial release

2023-02-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	First commit of the indie-org re-write.
	This commit:

	    - re-writes webmentions from scratch
	    - re-writes POSSE from scratch
	    - re-factors publication state out into its own package
	    - gives h-feed & rss their own packages
	    - moves publication-time stuff into its own package

	The code is still littered with TODOs, but it has a test suite
	and I'm now running my personal sites on this branch.

	Setting org-mode in the temp buffers for h-feeds & rss feeds
	Starting with Org mode 9.6, the logic for creating the sitemaps
	used with h-feeds & RSS feeds breaks. This commit invokes
	`(org-mode)` in the temp buffers used in the implementation
	thereof.

	Closes issue #3.

	    - fixes a bug in `indie-org-find-posts` that inadvertently
	      included *only* drafts in prod

	      the keys in the returned alist to be strings, when they are
	      in fact symbols
